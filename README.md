Algorithms
==========

This repository contains my implementations of several algorithms and data structures in C++ (credited to others where necessary). It has initially started out as a repository used for programming contests, but has since then grown into a repository involving a wide variety of implementations not typically useful for such events.
Will be updated periodically. You are free to use these codes wherever you want without permission. This comes without any warranties though!

Pull requests
----------------
If you spot any errors in the implementation(s), please let me know by submitting a relevant pull request. Furthermore, if you'd like to see a particular data structure or algorithm implemented here, let me know by raising an issue.
